# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Regularization using Lasso and Ridge

Using R, the college data set from the ISLR library was regularized. For both ridge and lasso models, testing and training are done while estimating the lambda minimum and one standard error values. Plot every regularization model before determining the RMSE value to look for overfitting. In the conclusion, we check with our regularization models using a stepwise selection technique.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, Regularization using Ridge and Lasso, Stepwise selection, Machine Learning, car, ISLR, MASS, Metrics libraries was used.    

## Output-

An objective report on regularization using Lasso and Ridge that is well-organized. To accomplish regularization, testing and training data sets were developed, and successful results were obtained.
