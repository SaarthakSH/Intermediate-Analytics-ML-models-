# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Non Parametric Statistical Methods and Simulation

Perform real-world issues with R and the Sign test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, signed rank test, Kruskal Wallis test, runs test, and Spearman's rank correlation test. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we create a real-world problem whose values change as a result of the sample being created repeatedly.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, Non Parametric Statistical Testing methods, Machine Learning, Hypothesis Testing, Simulation   

## Output-

A report on nonparametric statistical methods and simulation that is well-organized and objective. Hypothesis testing was used to address a variety of real-world issues and use cases before a Monte Carlo simulation was built and outcomes were obtained.
