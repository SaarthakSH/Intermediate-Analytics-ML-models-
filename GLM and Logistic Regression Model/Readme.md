# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# GLM and Logistic Regression Model

Exploratory and descriptive study of a collegiate data set from the ISLR library using R. Making a confusion matrix using the training and testing models of the logistic regression model after testing and training the data with glm. Ultimately, we will construct a ROC curve, evaluate its precision and accuracy, and take its AUC value.

## Skill used â€“ 

R, GLM and Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, ROC & AUC, Machine Learning, pROC, ISLR, caret libraries was used.  

## Output-

An objective report that is well-organized and covers the GLM and the Logistic Regression Model. The findings of the Logistic Regression Analysis were reached using the testing and training data sets that were prepared.
