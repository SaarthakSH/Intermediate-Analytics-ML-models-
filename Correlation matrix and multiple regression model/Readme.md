# How to access and execute RMD file

Installing and loading the necessary libraries and loading the associated data set are prerequisites for running the RMD R file. My recommendation is to make a folder to hold both the dataset and the RMD file when you download both, then inside that folder, make another folder called "DataSets" and put the excel file containing the data set inside of that. All of the work is done in a R Markdown file when you open the RMD file, and you must import the dataset in order to execute it. You can access the data set in the "DataSets" folder or any other name you like from the files tab. The route link for the imported data set must be copied after the data set has been imported since it must run with the installed libraries in order for the code to run. All codes should now run and function correctly after completing that. The codes can be knitted into PDF or HTML files, as desired.

# Correlation matrix and multiple regression model

Exploratory and descriptive analysis of the Ames Housing data set using R. Checked for NA values, and then replace them with the column's mean values. With the corrplot package, they then discussed their correlation matrix. doing multiple regression analysis on them after displaying scatterplots for various variables. Creating the four regression graphs and analyzing their multicollinearity. The final step is to search for outliers and remove them in order to correct our model. Finally, we used a subset regression technique to compare our model with the data.

## Skill used – 

R, Regression Analysis, Machine Learning, corrplot, dlookr, car, leaps libraries was used.

## Output-

A report that is objective and well-organized, with a linear and correlation matrix and a multiple regression model. built a regression model, then used its subset model to check.
